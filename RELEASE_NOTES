Avida 2.13 Release Notes

The following items are  features and changes present in this release of
Avida.

New Features:

- Environment Reaction Requisite : Reaction Max/Min Count Support

    Reaction requisites now support max_reaction_count and min_reaction_count.
    These requisites refer to the number of times a the specific reaction has
    been triggered, regardless of how many times the referenced task has been
    performed.



Enhancements:

-


Changes:

- cHardwareCPU first time Costs now honor DIVIDE_METHOD = OFFSPRING (0)

    cHardwareCPU no longer resets first time cost counts when DIVIDE_METHOD
    is set to DIVIDE_METHOD_OFFSPRING (0).  Other hardware types are not
    current affected.



Deprecated features will be removed in the next version of Avida.



Deprecated Features that will be removed in 2.14:

- START_CREATURE/START_ORGANISM Now Deprecated

    Use Inject actions at the beginning of your experiment to specify exactly
    how you would like the experiment to be seeded.

- HARDWARE_TYPE Setting and INST_SET File Deprecated

    Use the new instruction set format instead.  Backward compatibility may be
    activated by setting the avida.cfg option INST_SET_LOAD_LEGACY to 1.  The
    name of the instruction set will be the filename/path specified in INST_SET.



Known Issues:

- The PARENT_MUT_RATE setting will cause the parent's genome to mutate when
  it gives birth, but currently it is not treated like a second offspring, so
  the genotype will not be changed, and in general it cannot act with many
  other settings (like mutation reversions)

- BIRTH_METHOD 7 is currently a local birth method, but not grouped with the
  rest of them.  This required a special condition in cBirthChamber.cc for
  local recombination and in cPopulation.cc for offspring facing parent.
