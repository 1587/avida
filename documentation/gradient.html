<h1>The Environment File: Gradient Resources</h1>
</div>

<p>
Gradient resource format is:
</p>

<pre>
  GRADIENT_RESOURCE gradient_resource_name[:options]  {gradient_resource_name ...}
</pre>

<h2>Gradient Resources</h2>
<p>
Like other resources, all entries on a gradient resource line are names of individual 
resources. Gradient resources are a type of spatial resource, the main difference being
that gradient resources can move. 
</p>
<p>
Currently moving gradient resources are only supported for bounded grid environments.

<h3><A name = "GRADIENT_RESOURCE">GRADIENT_RESOURCE Command</A></h3>

<p>The syntax for the Gradient Resource command is:</p>

  <pre>GRADIENT_RESOURCE gradient_resource_name[:options]  {gradient_resource_name ...}</pre>

<p>
The Gradient Resource command allows the user to specify a resource distribution which changes over
time. If movement is enabled, this conical distribution moves randomly around the Avida grid. This movement 
may also be confined to an orbit around a specified anchor cell on the Avida grid. These are called halo gradients. 
Cones can be capped with a plateau cylinder of a determined height wherever cone height meets or exceeds the 
value of 1. In terms of actual resource value, this is analogous to slicing the cone at height 1 and then setting 
the actual resource value (plateau) in the sliced area to some flat value. Organisms can use sense instructions to 
detect resources on all parts of the cone, but they can only consume the resources where the value is >= min value 
in the associated reaction or collect instruction. Typically, the min value is set so that only the plateau area of
the cone can be consumed. When an organism consumes any part of the cone, the cone can be set to stop moving until 
a predifined number of updates (=decay) has passed or all consumable resource (all cells with value >= 1) has been 
consumed. The cone is then refreshed at some random location within the specified boundaries. An odd but useful quirk 
is that if decay is set to 1, you can have walking wounded resources.

  <td>
    Height in terms of resource value of the cone at the peak center.
    This affects values along the slope of the cone where the value of any cell on the slope
    = height/distance to center. Note that the height of the plateau may supersede the height 
    of the cone, lowering or raising all cell resource values within the plateau to the plateau 
    value. Since slope is height/distance, for a cone having a plateau and a height set to 10, 
    the plateau will be the region of cells 10 or fewer cells from the center.

    Actual initial height in terms of resource levels wherever cone height is greater or equal

    Number of updates until gradient resource is refreshed after an organism initially 
    consumes resources in the cone. The refresh will occur even if the plateau has not 
    been completely consumed. If decay = 0, the peak will be regenerated at a new random
    location every update, regardless of whether any has been consumed. If decay = 1, the 
    cone will never actually be regenerated, but will move continuously. If decay > 1, 
    resources move until some has been consumed. Movement will then halt until decay # 
    updates (including current) have passed and the cone will then be regenerated in a new 
    random location.

    Values range from 1 to 4. Values from 1 to around 3 yield smooth movements, while larger 
    values yield chaotic movement. In the current implementation of gradient resources, this
    value is largely irrelevant, but move_a_scaler = 1 means no movement and the common setting 
    for moving peaks is 3.8.

  <td class="resall">updatestep</td>
  <td>
    How many updates to wait until changing gradient resouce movement direction. 
    Resources move in random directions, only changing course if they bounce or
    when updatestep is reached. Low updatestep numbers result in chaotic peak
    movements (and peaks tend not to travel very far overall).

    Determines if this is a halo gradient. Instead of 
    moving in a predetermined box, halo resources move 
    randomly in an orbit around some fixed anchor cell. 1 if true,
    0 if false. Halos do not use the bounded box (min_x, max_x, 
    min_y, max_y) variables. Instead, they rely on the radius and
    width definitions to determine movement bounds. Note that orbit 
    distances are in terms of cells, so orbits are rectangle
    in Avida. A diagonal line of cells count as the same distance as a 
    straight line of cells.

    closest the center peak cell can be to the anchor, i.e. the minimum orbit. 
    If plateau is set, minimum orbit will be halo_inner_radius + height (since 
    radius of plateau = height). If you want a plateau of size 10 to be centered
    on the anchor point, you would need to set halo_inner_radius = -10. If you want
    the same peak to orbit the anchor point with no space between the plateau 
    and the anchor, halo_inner_radius would be set to 10.

   randomly changing orbit direction every updatestep.

  <td class="resall">move_speed</td>
  <td>
    How 'fast' the gradient moves in the grid. Since gradient resources are
    built on spatial resources and spatial resources are only checked once 
    per update, move_speed actually determines how far, in number of cells,
    the cone is moved between updates, not in an update. Thus move_speed > 1

	In determining the cell values within the plateau, do we treat them as a
  common (= 1) resource, or as individual cells (= 0)? If common = 1, and any
  plateau cells are depletabled by organisms, at each update we look to see 
  how much of the plateau was consumed, divide that by the number of cells in 
  the plateau, subtract that amount from the plateau value at the beginning of 
  the previous update (before depletion), and set all plateau cells to this new 
  value. Thus, at the updates, the effects of depletion is spread out across all 
  plateau cells. Peak height is then recalculated to reflect the <i>change in</i> 
  this value and the entire cone is redrawn, while preserving the original extent 
  of the plateau. If common = 0 resource depletions affect only individual plateau 
  cells and the peak slopes are not changed.

  If common = 1, the inflow is added to the current peak height and height is reset to the new

  Minimum resulting value for plateau cells is 0.

  If common = 1, the outflow quantity is subtracted from the current peak height and height is 
  reset to the new value. All values in the peak are then recalculated, but keeping the original

An example of setting a halo gradient of cone height 10 and radius 180.
The plateau height is 1, meaning that the actual resource height is
1 at cells where the cone height is at least 1. Movement is smooth
and is updated every 200 updates. The anchor cell is at 189, 249, and
it moves no closer than 10 cells away from the anchor and no farther than
30. The resource is immediately refreshed after it has been consumed by 
at least one organism.

<h3><A name = "DYNAMIC_RESOURCE">DYNAMIC_RESOURCE Command</A></h3>

<p>The syntax for the Dynamic Resource command is:</p>

  <pre>DYNAMIC_RESOURCE dynamic_resource_name[:options]  {dynamic_resource_name ...}</pre>

<p>

<p>
The Dynamic Resource command is an implementation of <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/tools.html#DF-1">Morrison and DeJong's</a> DF-1 algorithm applied
to spatial resources across the entire Avida grid. Please note that this option is still under
development and may not function as expected. A Dynamic Resource is a collection of cones which move
across the grid over time. These cones may also shift in total size, height, and number. A substantial
number of cones overlapping can create a complex resource landscape. For more information about the algorithm
please consult "A Test Problem Generator for Non-Stationary Environments", Ronald Morrison and Kenneth DeJong, 
Proceedings of the Congress on Evolutionary Computing 1999.
