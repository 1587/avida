<p>
This is the setup file for the task/resource system in Avida.
</p>
<p>
Six main keywords are used in this file, RESOURCE, GRADIENT_RESOURCE, REACTION, CELL, MUTATION, 
and SET_ACTIVE.  Their
formats are:
</p>
<pre>
  <a href="#RESOURCE">RESOURCE</a>  resource_name[:options]  {resource_name ...}
  <a href="#GRADIENT_RESOURCE">GRADIENT_RESOURCE</a>  gradient_resource_name[:options]  {gradient_resource_name ...}

  <a href="#SET_ACTIVE">SET_ACTIVE</a> type name new_status(default=true)
</pre>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>
All entries on a resource line are names of individual resources. Resources can
have a global quantity depletable by all organisms or can have quantities that
vary from cell to cell.  The resource name
<code>infinite</code> is used to refer to an undepletable resource.  There are
two basic commands to set up a general resource: RESOURCE and CELL. In addition, GRADIENT_RESOURCE is
a specific instance of RESOURCE which allows the user to specify a cellular distribution of
quantities that change over time in an Avida run. 
</p>

<h3><A name = "RESOURCE">RESOURCE Command</A></h3>

<p>The syntax for the Resource command is:</p>

  <pre>RESOURCE resource_name[:options]  {resource_name ...}</pre>

<Blockquote> 
<P>
Where <code>resource_name</code> is a unique name of the resource.  This name
may be used by the <code>CELL</code> command to further define the resource or
in the <code>REACTION</code> to define which resource is consumed/created
by a reaction.
</P>
<P>
Where <code>options</code> is a colon delimited list of factors that modify the 
resource. The following chart specifies these options.

<p>
An example of a RESOURCE statement that begins a run with a fixed amount of the
(global) resource in the environment, but has no inflow or outflows is:
<pre>
  RESOURCE  glucose:initial=10000
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you wanted to make this into a chemostat with a 10000 equilibrium
concentration for unused resources, you could put:
<pre>
  RESOURCE  maltose:initial=10000:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you want a resource that exists spatially where the resource enters
from the top and flows towards the bottom where it exits the system,
you could use:
<pre>
  RESOURCE lactose:geometry=grid:initial=100000:inflow=100:outflow=0.1:\
  inflowx1=0:inflowx2=100:inflowy1=0:inflowy2=0:outflowx1=0:outflowx2=100:\
  outflowy1=100:outflowy2=100:ygravity=0.5
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Defining a resource with no parameters means that it will start at a zero
quantity and have no inflow or outflow.  This is sometimes desirable if you
want that resource to only be present as a byproduct of a reaction.
Remember, though, that you should still have an outflow rate if it's in
a chemostat.

<h3><A name = "GRADIENT_RESOURCE">GRADIENT_RESOURCE Command</A></h3>

<p>The syntax for the Gradient Resource command is:</p>

  <pre>GRADIENT_RESOURCE gradient_resource_name[:options]  {gradient_resource_name ...}</pre>

<p>
The Gradient Resource command allows the user to specify a resource distribution which changes over
time. This conical distribution moves randomly around the Avida grid. This movement may also be confined
to an orbit around a specified anchor cell on the Avida grid. These are called halo gradients. Cones are capped with a plateau cylinder 
of a determined height wherever cone height meets or exceeds the value of 1. In terms of actual resource height, this is
analogous to slicing the cone at height 1 and then setting the actual resource height (plateau) in the sliced area at some flat value.
Organisms can use sense instructions to detect resources on all parts of the cone, but they can only consume the resources on the plateau. When an organism consumes any part of 
the plateau, the cone stops moving until the cone is refreshed at some random location within the specified boundaries. The cone refreshes 
when either the resource level in all plateau
cells is less than or equal to 1 or the decay time length has been exceeded.

An example of setting a halo gradient of cone height 10 and radius 180.
The plateau height is 1, meaning that the actual resource height is
1 at cells where the cone height is at least 1. Movement is smooth
and is updated every 200 updates. The anchor cell is at 189, 249, and
it moves no closer than 10 cells away from the anchor and no farther than
30. The resource is immediately refreshed after it has been consumed by 
at least one organism.

<p>
The Dynamic Resource command is an implementation of <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/tools.html#DF-1">Morrison and DeJong's</a> DF-1 algorithm applied
to spatial resources across the entire Avida grid. Please note that this option is still under
development and may not function as expected. A Dynamic Resource is a collection of cones which move
across the grid over time. These cones may also shift in total size, height, and number. A substantial
number of cones overlapping can create a complex resource landscape. For more information about the algorithm
please consult "A Test Problem Generator for Non-Stationary Environments", Ronald Morrison and Kenneth DeJong,

<h3><a name="CELL">CELL Command</a></h3>

Using Cell can help increase the detail of a spatial resource.  Any cell in a
grid can be given their own initial amount of a resource, inflow amount and 
outflow rate.  These values are in addition to any other values set for the
spatial resource for the entire for the grid (diffusion and gravity for 
instance). The command has the format:
</p>
  <pre>CELL resource_name:cell_list[:options]</pre>
<p>
<Blockquote>
Where <code>resource_name</code> is the name of the spatial resource that this 
cell command will modify.  If this resource has not been defined yet a new 
resource with this name will be created.
</P>
<p>
Where <code>cell_list</code> is comma delimited list of cells that will be set.
We treat the grid like a one dimensional array where 0 is the upper left corner,
world_x - 1 is the upper right corner, and (world_x * world_y) - 1 is the 
lower right corner.  As well as single cell you can also enter a range of 
cells by using the format a..b.

Reactions are set to allow organisms to consume or produce resources when those
organisms preform certain tasks.  Reactions can be used to reward (or punish) 
organisms for performing tasks or to set up a "food web". They 
are described by the task that triggers them, the processes they
perform (including resources used and the results of using them), and
requisites on when they can occur.

Each reaction must have a task that triggers it.  Currently, eighty tasks
have been implemented, as summarized in the following table (in approximate
order of complexity):

  <td class="resall">not</td>
  <td>
    This task is triggered when an organism inputs a 32 bit number,
    toggles all of the bits, and outputs the result.  This is typically
    done either by nanding (by use of the <tt>nand</tt> instruction) the
    sequence to itself, or negating it and subtracting one.  The latter
    approach only works since numbers are stored in twos-complement
    notation.

  <td>
    This task is triggered when two 32 bit numbers are input, the values
    are 'nanded' together in a bitwise fashion, and the result is output.
    Nand stands for "not and".  
    The nand operation returns a zero if and only if both inputs are one;
    otherwise it returns a one.

When describing a reaction, the <code>process</code> portion determines consumption
of resources, their byproducts, and the resulting bonuses.  There are several
arguments (separated by colons; example below) to detail the use of a resource. 
Default values are in brackets:

<p>
If no process is given, a single associated process with all default
settings is assumed.  If multiple process statements are given, <em>all</em> are
acted upon when the reaction is triggered.  Assuming you were going to set
all of the portions of process to be their default values, this portion of
the reaction statement would appear as:
<pre>
  process:resource=infinite:value=1:type=add:max=1:min=0:frac=1:product=none:conversion=1
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This statement has many redundancies; for example, it would indicate that the
associated reaction should use the infinite resource, making 'frac' and 'min'
settings irrelevant.  Likewise, since 'product' is set to none, the
'conversion' rate is never considered.
</p>
<p>
The <code>requisite</code> entry limits when this reaction can be triggered.  The
following requisites (in any combination) are possible:

<p>
No restrictions are present by default.  If there are multiple requisite 
entries, only *one* of them need be satisfied in order to trigger the
reaction.  Note though that a single requisite entry can have as many
portions as needed.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
We could simulate the pre-environment system (in which no resources were
present and task performance was rewarded with a fixed bonus) with a file
including only lines like:
<pre>
  REACTION AND logic:2a process:type=mult:value=4.0   requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION EQU logic:2h process:type=mult:value=32.0  requisite:max_count=1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
No RESOURCE statements need be included since only the infinite resource is
used (by default, since we don't specify another resource's name)
# To create an environment with two resources that are converted back and
forth as tasks are performed, we might have:
<pre>
  RESOURCE  yummyA:initial=1000
  RESOURCE  yummyB:initial=1000
  REACTION  AtoB  gobbleA  process:resource=yummyA:frac=0.001:product=yummyB
  REACTION  BtoA  gobbleB  process:resource=yummyB:frac=0.001:product=yummyA
</pre>
</p>
<p>
A value of 1.0 per reaction is default.  Obviously <code>gobbleA</code> and 
<code>gobbleB</code> would have to be tasks described within Avida.
</p>

<p>
A requisite against the other reaction being performed would prevent a
single organism from garnering both rewards in equal measure.
</p>
<p>
As an example, to simulate a chemostat, we might have:
<pre>
  RESOURCE glucose:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This would create a resource called "glucose" that has a fixed inflow rate of
10000 units where 20% flows out every update.  (Leaving a steady state of
50,000 units if no organism-consumption occurs).
</p>

<p>
Limitations to this system:
<ul>
<li>
  Only a single resource can be required at a time, and only a single
  by-product can be produced.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The default setup is:
<pre>
  REACTION  NOT  not   process:value=1.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  NAND nand  process:value=1.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  AND  and   process:value=2.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  ORN  orn   process:value=2.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  OR   or    process:value=3.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  ANDN andn  process:value=3.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  NOR  nor   process:value=4.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  XOR  xor   process:value=4.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
  REACTION  EQU  equ   process:value=5.0:type=pow  requisite:max_count=1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This creates an environment where the organisms get a bonus for performing
any of nine tasks.  Since none of the reactions are associated with a
resource, the infinite resource is assumed, which is non-depeletable.
The max_count of one means they can only get the bonus from each reaction
a single time.
</p>

<p>
A similar setup that has 9 resources, one corresponding to each of the nine
possible tasks listed above is:
<pre>
  RESOURCE  resNOT:inflow=100:outflow=0.01   resNAND:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
  RESOURCE  resAND:inflow=100:outflow=0.01   resORN:inflow=100:outflow=0.01

  RESOURCE  resNOR:inflow=100:outflow=0.01   resXOR:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
  RESOURCE  resEQU:inflow=100:outflow=0.01
  
  REACTION  NOT  not   process:resource=resNOT:value=1.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  NAND nand  process:resource=resNAND:value=1.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  AND  and   process:resource=resAND:value=2.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  ORN  orn   process:resource=resORN:value=2.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  OR   or    process:resource=resOR:value=4.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  ANDN andn  process:resource=resANDN:value=4.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  NOR  nor   process:resource=resNOR:value=8.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  XOR  xor   process:resource=resXOR:value=8.0:frac=0.0025
  REACTION  EQU  equ   process:resource=resEQU:value=16.0:frac=0.0025
