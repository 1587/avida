      <title>About Avida</title>
      <p>
        Avida is an auto-adaptive genetic system designed primarily for use  as a platform in Digital or
        Artificial Life research.  In lay terms, Avida is a digital world in which self-replicating
        computer programs mutate and evolve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avida allows us to study questions and perform experiments in evolutionalry dynamics and
        theoretical biology that are  intractable in real biological systems.

      <p>
        We will post fixes or new features as we develop them.  Please go to our development website on
        sourceforge (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/avida">http://sourceforge.net/projects/avida</a>)
        to report any bugs that you find or if you want to request a feature or submit a patch.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would like to be involved in discussions about ongoing Avida research
        or development, you should join the Yahoo Group
        <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DigitalEvolution/">DigitalEvolution</a>.
        If you are only interested in receiving notifications when we have published
        a new paper or when a major addition has been made to the software, join this
        group, but set your status to "Special Notices".  We expect, on average,
        there will only be 1-2 special notices per month.
